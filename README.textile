h3. Introduction

p. An earlier version of EEProperties has been renamed EEProperties-V1. This version of EEProperties (Version 2) is a total rewrite, and is not compatible with EEProperties V1, though most of the API will be similar. Usually, just renaming calls will be all that's needed to upgrade.

p. EEProperties is the main class for the EEProperties package. The package provides a simple, consistent approach to configuration based on run-time environments while allowing configuration files to be managed or overridden externally to the application.
